		<h2>About the Project!</h2>
</div>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p>The Kawartha Lakes Food Coalition has requested that AlphaProductions creates a web map that provides the
user information and the ability to view and submit data regarding public fruit trees in their community
that can be harvested to promote public food security. The overall problem this project is trying to solve
is the lack of awareness of free, healthy food that is accessible by the public, and ultimately increase the
food security of the Haliburton, Kawartha, Pine Ridge District Health Unit.
</p>

<H2>Abstract of the Project</H2>
<p>The goal is to create an open-source, completely
free web-application for the public as they are a community-based organization who foster programs
that align with their mission to create a sustainable food system for the Kawartha Lakes community.
The Kawartha Lakes Food Coalition has requested that the web-application is able to display point data
that provides information to the public on various Fruit Tree locations in the Kawartha Lakes. It is also a
requirement to allow the public to add point data to the map that will update the data that is displayed
for future users</p>

<H2>Our Client</H2>
<p>The Kawartha Lakes Food Coalition is a not-for-profit organization that is dedicated to Food Security in the 
Kawartha Lakes, Haliburton, and Pine Ridge regions of Ontario. Made up of members of the community, the Food 
Coalition is determined to increase Food Security by various means, including short-term relief (donations), 
capacity-building strategies (food banks and soup kitchens), and system redesign strategies that would make free 
food more accessible, continue the Basic Income Guarantee, increase Social Assistance rates, and increase Affordable 
Housing, which would help eliminate the need for the first two means.</p>
