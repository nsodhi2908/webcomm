<H2>Deliverables</H2>
<p>The deliverable for this project is a website that works for both a desktop and smartphone web browser
that allows the user to view a map with the collected data as well as use a link to a form that allows the
user to submit new tree data that is then repopulated on the map as real-time as seemingly possible.
This deliverable is our finished product, therefore it will be given and presented to the client when it is
finished, closer to the end of the project development phase, in the spring semester. Along the way we
plan on allowing our client to see our progress using test data and demo templates.

				<H4>Data Collection Form </H4>
				<p>KoboToolbox is an open-source form builder used to create a publicly accessible data collection method. We currently have a test 
				form for the development process, but the questions will be finalized into one form for submission. The form should have the following 
				functionality: </p>
				<p>-Record point location (either current, or set on a map) </p>
				<p>-Name the tree (Select from a dropdown of Ontario Fruit Trees) </p>
				<p>-Add a description including fruit yield, tips etc.</p> 
				<p>The form may also have notes populate under conditional responses: </p>
				<p>-Display links to recipes, harvest info when tree type is chosen </p>
				<p>The form data will be exported in GeoJSON format from the Endpoint URL. This will be manually exported for the development process, 
				and later integrated into an automated data transfer. </p>

				<H4>Leaflet Web Map </H4>
				<p>Leaflet is the open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. We created a web map using leaflet. It will be 
				extended with lots of plugins such as Rainviewer and Leaflet Search Bar. </p>
				<p>Rainviewer will be used to create a future radar animation for 1000+ weather radars in original resolution using the latest forecasting 
				techniques. It will be used to provide an hourly forecast for the next 48 hours and a general for the next 14 days. Future radar animation 
				provides a clear picture of the weather and the sky above to plan the day ahead for harvesting. </p>
				<p>Leaflet Search Bar will be used to insert a search widget on the map which allows the user to search by place names around the world and 
				once the place is selected, the map can be zoomed/centered to that place location. </p>

				<H4>Automation </H4>
				<p>Due to our choice to host our deliverables on Github, our best chance of creating an automated workflow was the leverage of Githubâ€™s 
				Actions functionality that allows the owner of a repository to set up a workflow that runs scripts within the repository. </p>
				<p>In this instance, our methodology is to use Postman.com to help create the python code that points to the KoboToolbox form submission 
				data in geoJSON format while using the appropriate authorization credentials. After that code is generated by Postman, a section must be 
				added that would take the response from the data request and write it to a geoJSON file in the repository. </p>
				<p>Once the script is finalized and edited to ensure its proper function, a workspace must be set up to call the script file from the 
				repository. To do this, a YAML file must be created that tells Github to complete tasks that are defined within the YAML file. </p>
				<p>At first, setting the YAML file up to run on a manual trigger is best to ensure the action runs properly before moving on to setting 
				it up to run on a schedule.</p>

				<H4>Webpage </H4>
				<p>This mapping application will be contained within a webpage using Leaflet. The theme of food security will carry through the webpage 
				content. This will include external links to harvesting guides, recipes, tree ID info etc. that are on previously created websites by 
				other people/organizations, and will assist the public in occupying the application with valuable and accurate info. </p>
				<p>These resources will be Ontario based information gathered and assessed by our team. As well as food resources, the web page will 
				offer information for utilizing the map. For example, explaining how to toggle features and navigate the data. This site will be user-friendly 
				and as accessible as possible.  </p>
